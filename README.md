Holds my work on Time Series Classification datasets from the UEA & UCR
repository.

## Motivation

The [Time Series
Classification](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/index.php)
website is a central repository of many datasets that are used for
binomial and multinomial classification work. These are seen as a
benchmarking set for algorithms to be tested on. This project hosts code
for my work on webscraping and analysing these datsets.
